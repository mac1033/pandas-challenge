- The students at Holden High School in grade 12 possess a higher average reading score (84.69). Students in grade 11 at Holden High School holds a higher math score (85) comparing all schools and grades.
- When the total number of students increases, the average math scores, the average reading scores, percent of passing math, percent of passing reading, and the overall passing rate decreases. From that, one can infer that when the student size rises, it negatively impacts student success.
